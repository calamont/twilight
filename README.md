This processing sketch is inspired by Reynolds’ boids algorithm to generate a swarm of of autonomous objects which generate a collective behaviour based off a few simple rules. Much guidance to the code was found in Daniel Shiffman’s [implementation of the algorithm](https://processing.org/examples/flocking.html). For large numbers of boids the code can become computationally expensive. [But the results can be pretty beautiful](https://youtu.be/8b3HLLoc3uE)

Most of the moving parts are found within boid.pde, which implements the boid object and the necessary functions/rules for its motion. 

Enjoy!
